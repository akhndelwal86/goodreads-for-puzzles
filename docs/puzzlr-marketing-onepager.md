## **The Missing Piece**

Picture this: You're standing in the puzzle aisle, overwhelmed by hundreds of options. *1000 pieces or 1500? Is this brand any good? How long will this actually take me? What if I hate the finish?* You grab something that looks pretty, only to discover three weeks later that the pieces barely fit together and the image is blurry. Sound familiar?a

**Sarah, a puzzle enthusiast from Seattle, knows this frustration all too well.** After completing over 200 puzzles, she was still shooting in the dark every time she wanted to try something new. Her dining room table became a graveyard of half-finished, disappointing puzzles. She wanted to connect with other puzzlers, share her wins, learn from their experiences ‚Äì but there was nowhere to go.

**The puzzle community had everything except a home.**
