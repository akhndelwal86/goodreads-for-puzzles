Now there's no time to lose. Who can grab the scurrying insect with the help of the cutlery on display? The dice decides whether the fork, knife or spoon is turned. If the cutlery is turned skillfully, the cockroach can be caught in a trap. Whoever owns the cockroach trap gets a chip. The first person to get five chips wins the hunt for the light-shy creepy-crawly! The starting maze can be varied for each new round of the game - but in the end, the cockroach always proves that it has a mind of its own and takes a completely different turn than expected! Kakerlakak is a fast-paced and fun hunt for clever trappers with original HEXBUG\u00ae nano\u2122. Winner of several awards, including the German Games Award for Best Children's Game 2013.", "image_urls": ["https://ravensburger.cloud/images/product-cover/520x445/Ravensburger-Bugs-in-the-Kitchen-22441.webp", "https://ravensburger.cloud/images/produktseiten/520x445/22441_1.webp"], "price": [["22.49", "USD"], ["29.99", "USD"]], "article_num": "22441", "ean": "4005556224418", "barcode": "4005556224418", "brand": "Ravensburger", "tags": ["family games", "children's games", "HEXBUG"], "product_url": "https://www.ravensburger.us/en-US/products/games/family-games/bugs-in-the-kitchen-22441", "age": "5+"}
