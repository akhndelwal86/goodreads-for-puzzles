Part of our Abandoned Series, this \u201cDeserted Department Store\u201d has gone to the birds! With no customers since the early 1950s, the mannequins are stuck in a time-warp of fashion, when women almost always wore dresses. What a shame some of the beautiful stained-glass ceiling panels are broken and the pigeons have made themselves at home. Did you know, those hats marked at $5 would cost over $55 today? Where do you think an elevator ride would take you? Puzzle it out for hours of fun! This 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle combines captivating imagery with clean-cut pieces and Ravensburger\u2019s perfect interlocking fit for a most pleasurable puzzling experience! Our puzzles are crafted with an exclusive, extra-thick cardboard backing along with our superior, linen-structured paper, so the printed image is vibrant, crisp, and glare-free. Create memorable moments with Ravensburger premium puzzles! Fun for ages 14 and up! Measures approximately 70 x 50 cm (27 x 19.5 inches) when completed.", "image_urls": ["https://ravensburger.cloud/images/product-cover/520x445/Jigsaw-Puzzle-Abandoned-Series-Deserted-Department-Store-1000-Pieces-Puzzle-16972.webp", "https://ravensburger.cloud/images/produktseiten/520x445/16972_1.webp"], "price": [["18.74", "USD"], ["24.99", "USD"]], "article_num": "16972", "ean": "4005556169726", "barcode": "4005556169726", "brand": "Ravensburger", "tags": ["Design", "Art & Creativity", "Engineering", "Everyday Life", "Work", "Culture", "Vintage"], "product_url": "https://www.ravensburger.us/en-US/products/jigsaw-puzzles/puzzles-for-adults/abandoned-series-deserted-department-store-16972", "age": "12+"}
