And preferably before the others! Everyone plays at the same time and it's brilliantly simple and simply brilliant! \"Brilliant\" is a roll & write game with a very special twist: one of the two numbers rolled on the dice must be entered next to the other (already entered number). It's easy to understand and quick to play, as everyone plays at the same time, but it gets trickier and trickier round after round as it gets more and more crowded on your pad sheets! Whoever completes the best fields first wins the game.", "image_urls": ["https://ravensburger.cloud/images/product-cover/520x445/Family-Game-Brilliant-Game-for-kids-8-years-up-23491.webp", "https://ravensburger.cloud/images/produktseiten/520x445/23491_1.webp"], "price": [["12.99", "USD"]], "article_num": "23491", "ean": "4005556234912", "barcode": "4005556234912", "brand": "Ravensburger", "tags": ["family games", "roll & write", "kids"], "product_url": "https://www.ravensburger.us/en-US/products/games/family-games/brilliant-23491", "age": "8 - 99"}
