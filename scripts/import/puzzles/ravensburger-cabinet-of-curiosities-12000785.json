Cars, cameras, clocks and cacti are just a few of the collectibles you\u2019ll find stuffed into each cubby in this \u201cCabinet of Curiosities\u201d puzzle! What treasures could be hidden in those little drawers? Scottish artist Zoe Sadler creates her own natural inks from things like hand-foraged gorse flowers (yellow), blackberry and elderberry (purples), silver acorn caps (grey) and alder cones (brown), resulting in these lovely, muted tones. A perfect puzzle for the copious collector on your gift list! This 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle combines captivating imagery with clean-cut pieces and Ravensburger\u2019s perfect interlocking fit for a most pleasurable puzzling experience! Our puzzles are crafted with an exclusive, extra-thick backing along with our superior, linen-structured paper, so the printed image is vibrant, crisp, and glare-free. About the Artist: Brought up on a small Scottish Croft in rural Aberdeenshire, Zoe Sadler\u2019s love of reading fairy tales and her penchant for an old-fashioned dip pen and pot of ink inspire her to create quirky hand-drawn illustrations. She also writes children's books. When not covered in black ink or with pen in hand, Zoe can most often be found foraging in the fresh air outdoors and walking her black lab, or tootling around the picturesque and inspiring Isle of Wight, where she now calls home. Measures approximately 27 x 20 inches (70 x 50 cm) when completed.
