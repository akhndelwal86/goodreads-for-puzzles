About the Artist: Nidhi Wadhwa started her art career selling handmade cards during her school years. Now the founder of her own firm, Blue Fish, Nidhi shares, \u201cKnowing that something you create \u2026 may be something [children] repeatedly see or interact with daily and remember into adulthood can seem a bit daunting for artists. It can also be a rewarding idea and experience to have touched the everyday life of our future generations with your paintings, illustrations, or even doodles.\u201d", "image_urls": ["https://ravensburger.cloud/images/product-cover/520x445/Childrens-Jigsaw-Puzzle-A-Day-at-the-Farm-60-Pieces-Puzzle-12004132.webp", "https://ravensburger.cloud/images/produktseiten/520x445/12004132_1.webp"], "price": [["13.99", "USD"]], "article_num": "12004132", "ean": "4005555041320", "barcode": "4005555041320", "brand": "Ravensburger", "tags": ["farm", "animals", "children", "educational"], "product_url": "https://www.ravensburger.us/en-US/products/jigsaw-puzzles/puzzles-for-kids/a-day-at-the-farm-12004132", "age": "4+"}
