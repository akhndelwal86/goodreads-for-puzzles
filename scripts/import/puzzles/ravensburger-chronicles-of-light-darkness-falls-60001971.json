Forge an unbreakable alliance as Moana, Violet, Maid Marian, and Belle. Embark on perilous quests, unlock hidden powers, and drive back shadows of infamous Disney villains. As a team, you must share ideas, discuss, and coordinate how you will harness your extraordinary talents before the Darkness falls each round. Only by embracing teamwork can you restore the Realm of Light! In this cooperative board game of action and adventure, there are no traditional turns. Instead, players share Actions during rounds, known as days, and work together to determine how those are used across all characters on the board. Combine Actions wisely to complete quests, defeat villains, and destroy the vortex before your team\u2019s health tracker reaches 0 or you run out of Darkness cards.", "image_urls": ["https://ravensburger.cloud/images/product-cover/520x445/Ravensburger-Chronicles-of-Light-Darkness-Falls-60001971.webp", "https://ravensburger.cloud/images/produktseiten/520x445/60001971_1.webp"], "price": [["26.24", "USD"], ["34.99", "USD"]], "article_num": "60001971", "ean": "810558019719", "barcode": "810558019719", "brand": "Ravensburger", "tags": ["Disney", "cooperative", "board game", "family"], "product_url": "https://www.ravensburger.us/en-US/products/games/family-games/chronicles-of-light-darkness-falls-60001971", "age": "8+"}
