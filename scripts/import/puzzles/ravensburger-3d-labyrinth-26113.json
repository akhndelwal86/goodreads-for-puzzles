In a labyrinth of soaring towers and deep vaults, witches and wizards scramble to find coveted treasures. They cast powerful spells to teleport and shift the maze in their favor. Whoever collects their treasure first wins in this contest of minds and magic! The special feature of the 3D Labyrinth is that towers can now be climbed that are a maximum of one level higher or lower than the tower from which your character is currently coming. Unless, that is, you have magic cards that allow you to circumvent the level rule. Luck and strategy help you win this game. The first player to find all their treasures and move to the rune stone in the middle of the board at least once during the game wins.", "image_urls": ["https://ravensburger.cloud/images/product-cover/520x445/Family-Game-3D-Labyrinth-Game-for-kids-7-years-up-26113.webp", "https://ravensburger.cloud/images/produktseiten/520x445/26113_1.webp"], "price": [["36.99", "USD"]], "article_num": "26113", "ean": "4005556261130", "barcode": "4005556261130", "brand": "Ravensburger", "tags": ["family games", "3D", "labyrinth", "magic", "strategy"], "product_url": "https://www.ravensburger.us/en-US/products/games/family-games/3d-labyrinth-26113", "age": "7 - 99"}
