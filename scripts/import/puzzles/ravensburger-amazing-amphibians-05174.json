Our array of \"Amazing Amphibians\" can! There\u2019s nothing puzzling about how cool these cold-blooded amphibians are! A red-eyed tree frog is joined by a colorful variety of poison dart frogs, both real and imagined (the rainbow one), as well as a fire salamander and insects. Most frogs are nocturnal, but these colorful bodies warn other animals, \u201cDon\u2019t eat me!\u201d so they are active during the day! Puzzles help develop hand-eye coordination, fine motor skills and problem-solving through repeated practice while delivering leaps of fun! Did you know a group of poison frogs is called an army? They measure from less than 1.5\u201d to almost 2.5\u201d long. Some of the species here include: blue poison dart (bottom left), red striped poison dart frog (right side) and a dyeing dart frog (bottom right). The red-eyed tree frog (center) has large suction-cup pads to climb and cling to branches and leaves. And if a predator grabs a fire salamander (bottom center) by its tail, toe or leg, it can break off that limb and grow a new one to replace it! This 35-piece puzzle has extra-large, durable pieces little hands can easily hold on to for lots of repeat fun. Clean-cut pieces and Ravensburger\u2019s tight interlocking fit provide a pleasurable puzzling experience for children and their adult helpers alike.
