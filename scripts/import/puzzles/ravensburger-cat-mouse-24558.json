Slide through the cheese and enjoy every bite. Watch out \u2014 Max the Cat is on the prowl! Which mouse can eat the most in this cheesy chase? The mice are moved in this dice-based running game using an eye dice. A second dice, known as the paw dice, determines how far the cat can move. Both dice are thrown on each turn, and then the mouse is moved first, followed by the cat. Depending on which square the mice land on during their turn, they can collect one or two cheese pieces. During their race for the cheese, the little rodents repeatedly encounter special squares. For example, the ladder square: if a mouse lands on this square, it can climb up the ladder to the cheese and then slide back down through the holes onto the playing field. Where will it land? Then there is also the field with the mouse hole: here, the mice are safe from Max the cat, who loves nothing more than teasing the little mice. Who will be the first player to collect five delicious cheese corners and win the cheese hunt?", "image_urls": ["https://ravensburger.cloud/images/product-cover/520x445/Ravensburger-Cat-Mouse-24558.webp", "https://ravensburger.cloud/images/produktseiten/520x445/24558_2.webp"], "price": [["18.74", "USD"], ["24.99", "USD"]], "article_num": "24558", "ean": "4005556245581", "barcode": "4005556245581", "brand": "Ravensburger", "tags": ["games", "kids", "family"], "product_url": "https://www.ravensburger.us/en-US/products/games/games-for-kids/cat-mouse-24558", "age": "4 - 99"}
